Fellow peer Hassan Razak assisted with this project.

During this project, one of the main challenges I encountered was aligning the design exactly with the desktop layout provided in the reference image. Ensuring similiar spacing and responsive behavior using Bootstrap while incorporating custom styles required careful balancing. Another hurdle was getting the background image and progress bar to match the original Figma design closely, especially across different screen sizes.

To address these issues, I broke the design down into  sections, used Bootstrap's grid system for layout structure, and then layered custom CSS for better control over alignment, spacing, and background positioning. I also tested frequently in different viewports to adjust for mobile responsiveness.

Overall, this project helped strengthen my understanding of combining frameworks like Bootstrap with custom styles to build real-world UI components.
